# Development Documentation

This document serves as the central index for all technical documentation related to the project's development tasks. Here you will find links to detailed documentation for each task, as well as an overview of the system architecture.

## Architecture Overview

The project is a user CRUD API implemented with TypeScript and Express. The architecture follows a layered model with clear separation of responsibilities:

1. **Routes Layer**: Manages HTTP endpoints and directs requests to the appropriate controllers
2. **Controllers Layer**: Contains business logic and interacts with models
3. **Models Layer**: Represents data and includes logic for data manipulation
4. **Middleware**: Provides cross-cutting functionalities such as validation, error handling, and logging

### Main Components

- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js
- **TypeScript**: Adds static typing to JavaScript
- **Jest**: Testing framework
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: API documentation
- **Winston**: Logging library
