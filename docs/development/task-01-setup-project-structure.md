# Task #1: Setup Project Structure and Dependencies

## Purpose and Scope
The purpose of this task was to initialize the TypeScript Express project with the necessary dependencies and folder structure as specified in the PRD. This task represents the foundation of the entire project, establishing the basic infrastructure needed for API development.

## Technical Architecture and Design Decisions
The project configuration follows a standard modular structure for Node.js applications with TypeScript and Express. Important decisions include:

1. **TypeScript as Language**: Chosen to provide static typing, improving code quality and development experience
2. **Express as Web Framework**: Selected for its lightness, flexibility, and wide adoption in the Node.js community
3. **Jest for Testing**: Comprehensive testing framework to ensure code quality
4. **Directory Structure by Responsibility**: Organization of files in directories by function (models, controllers, routes, etc.)
5. **NPM Scripts for Automation**: Configuration of scripts for development, build, and tests

└── jest.config.js     # Jest configuration
```

## Implementation Details

### Code Structure
The project structure follows standard conventions for Node.js/Express applications:
- **src/**: Contains all TypeScript source code
- **dist/**: Contains compiled JavaScript files
- **Configuration Files**: At the root of the project (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)

### Utilized Patterns
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between models, controllers, and routes
2. **Dependency Management**: Dependencies managed via npm/package.json
3. **Configuration as Code**: Declarative configuration via JSON files

### Main Implemented Configurations

#### package.json
```json
{
  "name": "cursor-crud-user",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node dist/server.js",
    "dev": "nodemon src/server.ts",
    "build": "tsc",
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^5.1.0",
    "morgan": "^1.10.0",
    "winston": "^3.17.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/express": "^5.0.1",
    "@types/jest": "^29.5.14",
    "@types/morgan": "^1.9.9",
    "@types/node": "^22.15.17",

    "testEnvironment": "node",
    "testMatch": [
      "**/__tests__/**/*.test.ts"
    ]
  }
}
```

#### tsconfig.json
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es6",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules", "**/*.test.ts"]
}
```

## Dependencies

### Internal Components
- **Does not depend on other components**: This is the initial task that establishes the foundation for all other components

### Components that Depend on This Task
- **User Model (Task #2)**: Depends on the directory structure and TypeScript configuration
- **Express Server Configuration (Task #3)**: Depends on the dependencies and basic configuration
- **All other components**: Indirectly depend on the established infrastructure

### External Systems
- **Node.js**: Execution environment
- **npm**: Package manager
- **TypeScript**: Compiler
- **Jest**: Testing framework

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables
- `PORT`: Port on which the server will run (default: 3000)
- `NODE_ENV`: Execution environment (development, production, test)

### Application Configuration
To configure the project:
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run in development mode: `npm run dev`
3. Compile for production: `npm run build`
4. Run tests: `npm test`

## Known Limitations
1. Does not include a database migration system (uses in-memory storage)
2. Does not include configuration for deployment in production environments
3. Does not implement secret management for sensitive environment variables

## Potential Future Improvements
1. Add configuration for Docker/containerization
2. Implement ORM system for data persistence
3. Add linting and automatic formatting (ESLint, Prettier)
4. Implement CI/CD for build and test automation
5. Add automatic code documentation (TSDoc)

## Code Examples and Usage Patterns

### Running the Project in Development Environment
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start server in development mode (with hot reload)
npm run dev
```

### Preparing for Production
```bash
# Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
npm run build

# Start server with compiled code
npm start
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem 1: TypeScript Compilation Errors
**Symptoms:**
- Errors when running `npm run build`
- Type or syntax error messages

**Solution:**
1. Verify that TypeScript and its dependencies versions are compatible
2. Check if types are correctly defined and imported
3. Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to check for errors without generating files

### Problem 2: Test Failures
**Symptoms:**
- Errors when running `npm test`
- Tests failing with environment errors

**Solution:**
1. Verify that Jest is correctly configured in package.json
2. Make sure ts-jest is installed and configured
3. Check if test files follow the pattern `*.test.ts` and are in the `__tests__` directory
